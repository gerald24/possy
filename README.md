Possy was created based on [Boris's](https://github.com/boris779) idea to print out tasks, bugs and other issues on POS Printer (e.g. Epson TM-T20II) instead of using Post-itÂ®, or print it on regular paper and use the scissor. Possy is an addition for ***physical scrum and kanban boards***.

## Overview

![Overview](resources/Overview.png)

## Components

Possy is split into 2 parts:
- possy-daemon
- possy-service

### possy-daemon

The daemon part connects to a possy-service and fetches print requests (simply text or image content). For each print request a PDF will be generated and printed via [CUPS](https://www.cups.org) to one or more connected POS Printer(s). The daemon job might run on a [Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org).

### possy-service

The service is a Vaadin frontend, which creates print requests either by retrieving content from Jira (or other Providers) or get manually entered issues.

## Issuetypes

Possy knows 4 different types of issues:
- Stories
- Tasks
- Bugs
- Freeform (like a note)

## Printers

The issuetypes are mapped to 3 different printer which might use different colors:
- Stories -> white
- Tasks -> white
- Bugs -> pink
- Freeform -> yellow

## Planner

The Planner helps to batch print Freeform issues (in case tasks and sub-tasks not tracked in Jira or others)
