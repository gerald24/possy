Possy was created based on [Boris's](https://github.com/boris779) idea to print out tasks, bugs and other issues on POS Printer (e.g. Epson TM-T20II) instead of using Post-itÂ®, or print it on regular paper and use the scissor. Possy is an addition for ***physical scrum and kanban boards***.

## Overview

![Overview](docs/img//Overview.png)

## Components

- possy-daemon (print job)
- possy-service (print requests and [Planner](docs/PLANNER.md))
- [CUPS](https://www.cups.org) (print platform) - see also [Installation Guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md) for setup
- providers lika [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), GitHub, etc. (currently only [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) supported)

### possy-daemon

The daemon part connects to a possy-service and fetches print requests (simply text or image content). For each print request a PDF will be generated and printed via [CUPS](https://www.cups.org) to one or more connected POS Printer(s). The daemon job might run on a [Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org).

### possy-service

The service is a Vaadin frontend, which creates print requests either by retrieving content from Jira (or other Providers) or get manually entered issues.

## Issuetypes

Possy knows 4 different types of issues:
- Stories
- Tasks
- Bugs
- Freeform (like a note)

## Printers

The issuetypes are mapped to 3 different printer which might use different colors:
- Stories -> white
- Tasks -> white
- Bugs -> pink
- Freeform -> yellow
