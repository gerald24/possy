# possy [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gerald24/possy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gerald24/possy) [![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=net.g24.possy%3Areactor&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=net.g24.possy%3Areactor) [![Coverage](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=net.g24.possy%3Areactor&metric=coverage)](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=net.g24.possy%3Areactor)

Possy was created based on [Boris's](https://github.com/boris779) idea to print out tasks, bugs and other issues on POS Printer (e.g. Epson TM-T20II) instead of using Post-itÂ®. This can be used as an addition for ***physical scrum and kanban boards***.

Possy is split into 2 parts:
- possy-daemon
- possy-service

## possy-daemon [![Heroku possy-daemon](https://heroku-badge.herokuapp.com/?app=possy-daemon)](https://possy-daemon.herokuapp.com/)

The daemon part connects to a possy-service and fetches print requests (simply text or image content). For each print request a PDF will be generated and printed via [CUPS](https://www.cups.org) to one or more connected POS Printer(s). The daemon job might run on a [Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org).

## possy-service [![Heroku possy-service](https://heroku-badge.herokuapp.com/?app=possy-service)](https://possy-service.herokuapp.com/)

The service is a Vaadin frontend, which creates print requests either by retrieving content from jira or get manually entered issues.
